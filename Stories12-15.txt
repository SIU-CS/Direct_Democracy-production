Security
As a user, I want my account to be secure, so I am the only one who can use it.
1. The application will use secure connections to the login servers.
2. Login information stored on the server will be hashed.

Well Designed
As a user, I want the application to be well designed, so that it is easily usable and necessary information is readily available to the user.
1. Notifications (notifications on mobile devices, emails, etc.) will alert the user of new things to vote on.
2. Simple design, very little numbers (mainly use graphs for showing results) and only necessary text on each page.

Objectivity
As a user, I want votes to be objective, so results have more meaning.
1. Present the user with an unbiased summary of the item to be voted on.
2. Give the user links to news articles from various sources, preferrably multiple from across the political spectrum.
3. Keep the results of a vote hidden from the user until the user has voted.

Privacy
As a user, I want privacy, so my votes will not be shown to anyone else.
1. Users will be able to see how they voted on an item.
2. Users will be able to see the total vote results on an item, but not how any other specific user has voted.
