        Direct Democracy is...

		<h4><i>about voting.</i></h4>
        We believe that the best form of
        representation is <em>direct</em> representation.

		<h4><i>about getting people involved.</i></h4>
		We want to remind people that their vote is their voice,
		and that their voice actually contains the element of power.


		<p><i>Start caring. Start voting. Start being a citizen.</i></p>
              </p>
